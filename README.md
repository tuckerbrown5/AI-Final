NFL Season Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project analyzes NFL team performance data from 2003 to 2025 to:

Identify the most improved teams.
Predict the 2025 Super Bowl winner using machine learning.
The implementation involves:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Combining historical and recent datasets, mapping team conferences, and normalizing team statistics.
Dimensionality Reduction: Applying Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extract significant features.
Machine Learning: Training a Naive Bayes Classifier for performance trend analysis and Super Bowl prediction.
Installation Instructions
1. System Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
Conda environment manager (preferred) or pip
2. Required Libraries
You can install the necessary dependencies with either Conda or pip. Use one of the following commands:

Using Conda:
bash
Copy code
conda install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy -y
Using Pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy
Project Files
NFL_Team_Data.csv: Primary dataset containing NFL team statistics from 2003 to 2024.
Additional Data.csv: Supplemental dataset for expanding the data scope.
main_script.py: Python script containing all code blocks for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
Updated_Data.csv: Preprocessed data file including conference mappings and cleaned team statistics.
How to Run the Project
1. Load and Prepare Data
Place the NFL_Team_Data.csv and Additional Data.csv files in the project directory.
Run the script to clean and preprocess the data. This step is covered in Code Blocks 1-5.
2. Perform Dimensionality Reduction
Apply ICA to reduce dataset complexity and capture the most informative components. This step is implemented in Code Block 8.
3. Train and Test the Naive Bayes Classifier
Split the data into training and testing subsets.
Train a Naive Bayes model to predict team performance and Super Bowl outcomes. These steps are implemented in Code Blocks 7 and 11.
4. Analyze Results
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
View predictions and results through printed outputs and visualizations, as shown in Code Blocks 9 and 12.
Key Outputs
Performance Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, and Recall for classification tasks.
Improved Teams:
Identification of the most improved team in each conference.
Predicted Winner:
Forecast of the 2025 Super Bowl winner.
Contributing
Feel free to contribute by:

Improving the modelâ€™s accuracy through advanced algorithms.
Expanding the dataset with additional features or historical data.
Enhancing visualizations for better data interpretation.
Troubleshooting
Dependencies not installed:
Ensure all required libraries are installed using the commands provided in the Installation Instructions section.
Dataset issues:
Ensure NFL_Team_Data.csv and Additional Data.csv are correctly formatted and located in the working directory.
Visualization errors:
Ensure Matplotlib is installed and functioning:
bash
Copy code
conda install matplotlib -y
